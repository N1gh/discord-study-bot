WHY VERB TENSES MATTER
Verb tenses show when an action happens.

COMMON CONFUSION
Portuguese often uses different tenses than English in similar situations.

EXAMPLE
"Eu moro aqui há dois anos."
Literally: I live here for two years.
Meaning: I have lived here for two years.

WHY THIS HAPPENS
Portuguese focuses on the duration as ongoing, not completed.
