WHAT ARE PREPOSITIONS
Prepositions show relationships between words, such as place, time, or direction.

COMMON PORTUGUESE PREPOSITIONS
de = of / from
em = in / on / at
para = to / for
com = with

EXAMPLE
"Eu vou para o Brasil."
I am going to Brazil.

WHY IT'S CONFUSING
Portuguese prepositions do not always match English usage one-to-one.
