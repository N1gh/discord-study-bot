WHY ACCENTS EXIST
Portuguese uses accent marks to show pronunciation and sometimes meaning.

ACCENTS CHANGE MEANING
Some words change meaning depending on the accent.

EXAMPLE: PODE vs PÔDE
"Pode" = present tense (can)
"Ele pode ir hoje." → He can go today.

"Pôde" = past tense (could / was able to)
"Ele pôde ir ontem." → He was able to go yesterday.

WHY THIS MATTERS
Without the accent, the reader may misunderstand the tense or pronunciation.
